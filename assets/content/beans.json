We certainly think so. Knuckles is a blend of beans from Ethiopia, El Salvador, and Sumatra, and we spent a lot of time getting this blend right. And by ‘right’ we mean each variety shines through, and yet the sum is still somehow greater than the parts. You’re not a commodity, don’t settle for commodity mystery blends. Knuckles: because we didn’t come here to screw around.",
